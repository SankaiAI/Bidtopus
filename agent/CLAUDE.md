# CLAUDE.md — Agent

You own everything inside `agent/`. You are the core of the product — an autonomous economic agent that underwrites performance contracts, negotiates terms, executes Meta Ads strategies, monitors outcomes, and triggers settlement.

Read [AGENT.md](AGENT.md) for the component map. Read [README.md](README.md) for engineering principles. Read [PRD.md](PRD.md) for full requirements. Read `docs/` for deep context on any specific component.

## Local Environment Setup

Always work inside a virtual environment. Never install packages globally.

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate        # Mac/Linux
.venv\Scripts\activate           # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you install a new package, add it to `requirements.txt` immediately:
```bash
pip install <package> && pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

## Non-Negotiable Rules

1. LLM never makes the settlement call. The deterministic resolution engine does.
2. No ad execution without merchant approval. Re-read approval status from DB with a row lock before calling any adapter.
3. Log intent before execution. Write to the audit logger BEFORE calling any adapter. If the process crashes, the intent is already persisted.
4. All LLM outputs are structured JSON. Validate the schema before any downstream action. Invalid output raises an error — never silently defaults.
5. Routing is state-driven, not keyword-driven. Contract state determines the next valid action. Never parse text to decide what to do.
6. Merchant input never in the system prompt. All merchant-controlled fields go in the `user` turn as structured JSON. The system prompt is a fixed constant.
7. Three interaction modes never mix. Negotiation loop, background scheduler, and chat Q&A are separate code paths. Chat Q&A has zero imports from execution modules.
8. Negotiation loop has a turn limit. Auto-reject when the limit is reached — see `config.py` for the value.

## When to Raise a Ticket

Raise a ticket when you hit something you **cannot resolve by reading your own files**.

| Situation | What to do |
|---|---|
| You need an endpoint, schema, or behavior owned by another component | Ticket to that component — `needs: backend/frontend/contracts` |
| The PRD and README contradict each other | Ticket to human — `needs: human` |
| Completing your work requires changing another component's behavior | Ticket to that component before making any assumptions |
| You think your own PRD needs to change | Ticket to human — `needs: human` — do not self-edit |

**Do not raise a ticket for:**
- Anything answerable by reading your own `PRD.md`, `README.md`, `AGENT.md`, or `docs/`
- Implementation decisions within your own directory
- Clarifications you can resolve with a reasonable assumption — make the assumption, note it in a code comment, keep moving

**Never edit another component's PRD or README.** If you believe a change is needed, raise a `needs: human` ticket describing what should change and why. The human decides.

## Cross-Team Coordination

### Setup — run this once at the start of every session

```bash
export GH_TOKEN=$(printf "protocol=https\nhost=github.com\n" | git credential fill 2>/dev/null | grep password | cut -d= -f2)
export PATH="$PATH:/c/Program Files/GitHub CLI:/usr/local/bin"
```

This loads your GitHub token and adds `gh` to the PATH so all commands below work. Works on Windows, Mac, and Linux.

---

### Step 1 — Find and read your tickets

```bash
gh issue list --label "needs: agent" --state open --repo SankaiAI/outcomeX
gh issue view <number> --repo SankaiAI/outcomeX
```

Read the full issue. The **Request** section says what to build. The **Definition of Done** says what your response must include.

### Step 2 — Verify the ticket belongs to you

Before claiming, check your own codebase to confirm the work described lives inside `agent/`.

Ask yourself:
- Does the change touch files I own?
- Is the capability being requested something I build, not another component?

**If yes — the ticket is yours:** proceed to Step 3.

**If no — the ticket was mislabeled:** comment to redirect it and do not claim it.

```bash
gh issue comment <number> --body "This looks like it belongs to [correct team]. Redirecting." --repo SankaiAI/outcomeX
gh issue edit <number> --remove-label "needs: agent" --add-label "needs: [correct team]" --repo SankaiAI/outcomeX
```

### Step 3 — Claim the ticket and move it to In Progress

Only do this after confirming ownership in Step 2.

```bash
gh issue comment <number> --body "Confirmed this is mine. Picking it up now." --repo SankaiAI/outcomeX
bash .github/scripts/move_issue.sh <number> "In Progress"
```

This posts your pickup note and moves the card to the In Progress column on the project board.

### Step 4 — Close the ticket when done

```bash
gh issue comment <number> --body "Done. [your answer or summary of what was built]" --repo SankaiAI/outcomeX
gh issue close <number> --repo SankaiAI/outcomeX
bash .github/scripts/move_issue.sh <number> "Done"
```

Close the issue first, then move the card to Done. The requester sees your comment as the answer.

---

### Before creating any ticket — search first

```bash
gh issue list --repo SankaiAI/outcomeX --state open --search "keywords describing your issue"
```

If an open ticket already covers what you need, comment on it instead of opening a new one. Only create a new ticket if nothing matches.

### When you need something from another team

```bash
gh issue create \
  --title "[agent → contracts] Short description" \
  --label "needs: contracts,api-contract" \
  --repo SankaiAI/outcomeX \
  --body "**From:** agent
**To:** contracts
**Blocking:** what cannot be built until this is answered

## Request

## Definition of Done"
```

### When you need a human decision (spec conflict or PRD change)

```bash
gh issue create \
  --title "[agent → human] Short description of the conflict or proposed change" \
  --label "needs: human" \
  --repo SankaiAI/outcomeX \
  --body "**From:** agent
**Type:** spec-conflict OR prd-change-request
**Blocking:** what cannot be built until this is resolved

## What the current spec says

## What the problem is

## What I propose"
```
